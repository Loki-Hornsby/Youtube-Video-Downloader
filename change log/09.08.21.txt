Opened Changelog Manually - script may be created later to automate this a bit more


FIRST LOG

+ Change download location
+ Download playlists
+ Download single videos
+ Show Errors
+ Show download complete message
+ Threading of multiple videos and playlists

# Exe is flagged as a virus
# Threading multiple playlists can cause crashes
# No catch exception for ghost errors in downloading private videos
# Not all of videos in playlist download (Pytube problem i thinks)
# Not working on others machines


HUGE CLEANUP  

+ Changed file environment to be cleaner

- Deleted stand alone executable for now
- Removed toast notifications
- Removed download directory as default location and changed it to be within its own folder (possibly making it close to be available on linux and mac)


Post Clean up

+ Fixed Playlist download (making 2 try statements without any if statements made it always revert to single download mode)
