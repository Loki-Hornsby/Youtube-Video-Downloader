Creating an output log

% changed Song in variables to Video

	|   + clears file each time their opened
	|   + create/get log.txt file
	|   + outputs os and other info
    V   + outputs errors, warnings and other info

+ added blank thread for if video already exists
	+ downloads is no longer called in this case
+ added conditional logs (i.e video link is invalid)
	+ added video download already exists
	+ added video link is invalid
	+ added video download to a thread
+ tidied up VideoName variable definition - no idea what i was doing there - must be artefacts from old code
	+ also removed any remanants of self.VideoName since i believe this would cause issues making a name global
+ added binds to notepad++ for easier changelog creation
